# If, Else, Elif â€“ Making Python Think!

Today I learned how to make Python code **think** and **decide** using `if`, `else`, and `elif`. I can now build programs that react to input or situations!

---

## I Learned:

- What conditions are (True/False questions)
- How to check a condition with `if`
- How to add fallback with `else`
- How to handle many choices using `elif`

---

## What I Practiced:

- Checking if someone is hungry
- Deciding if someone can vote
- Guessing a number and responding to it
- Making a password lock
- Writing a grade-checker tool

---

## Portfolio Project:

I built a **Grade Checker Tool**:
- You give it a number score
- It returns a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.)
- Adds reactions like "You got an A "
